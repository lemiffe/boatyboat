                        <p>
                            2022 is an EP inspired by sketches I recorded during
                            that year in Belgium. The challenge for this month's
                            EP was to bounce all tracks via cassette tapes
                            before mastering. I failed. Kind of.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The resulting audio was very interesting, with some
                            artifacts here and there, a bit of tape wobble,
                            warmer audio, and a bit of harmonic saturation,
                            everything I hoped for… EXCEPT for the fact that not
                            only was there tape hiss (expected) but also a weird
                            mechanical noise that I couldn’t get rid of. Oh, and
                            the playback speed was faster as well, I could have
                            digitally slowed it down to match but that also
                            introduces digital artifacts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That's the downside of using an old machine, and
                            unfortunately sending it for repairs (or learning
                            how to do this myself) would probably take a while,
                            and we have to move onto the next EP!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So I'll be including both the standard version as
                            well as the tape one in this release. On other
                            services I'll only be releasing the normal version,
                            but by purchasing it

                            you can hear the difference between both versions!
